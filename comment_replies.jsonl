Their access to capital was already dwindling and getting more expensive, unlike the 2014-2016 downturn when they were recapitalized quickly with the promise of strong future cash flow. I expect a lot of bankruptcies and consolidation in that sector and probably reduction in US production numbers over time."}

Think bigger, why not six? Also let's have the battery persistently re-charge using contact with our body. \nThe camera! I'd need at least duodecuple *(That means 12, I'm just really smart)* set up. The array would be comprised of,\n\n1000mp main shooter\n\n500mp f38.8 360 degree (pairs with front facing to achieve this.)\n\n10,000 mp macro...\n\n2mp 180 degree\n\n10mp 120 degree\n\nI could go on...\n\nAlso I think we could squeeze in a smart DNA testing unit, so I could find out if these kids are actually mine."}

You're quite literally working with ones and zeros, you can make transistors, logic gates, little registers, and eventually if you're masochistic enough a whole fully fledged calculator!! No expensive logic gates, wires, eeproms, breadboards and everything needed to do it irl, just a copy of minecraft and a lot of patience!"}

I started out with Ipsy and stuck with them until the first glam bag ultimate then cancelled. They rarely have the same quality as far as brand names go as Boxycharm and they use face masks as fillers which I cannot stand. You get single brushes rather than the sets you get in Boxy...single eyeshadows...just chintzy stuff. Sample sizes are abundant with Ipsy\ud83d\udeab\nBoxyCharm is by far my favorite for makeup."}
